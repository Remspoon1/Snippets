# Welcome to Snippets!

As induvidual students we were provided with the huge source code for SNIPPETS. We were tasked initiallt with locating and fixing bugs in the code and then adding features to this code base. For example, I created functionality that

 - allowed a user to manualy choose an avatar for existing avatars or upload one of their own 

 - added metrics to the comments sections that tracked the amount of time since a comment had been posted

 - addeed search and delete functionality to the post thread

 - created custom endpoints that captures the user email and added it to the dat amodel. 

 Overall, this gave a a good opportunity to work with a large code base created by another developer that required I first get used familiar with the code before making any changes or fixes.
