# Welcome to Snippets!

As induvidual students we were provided with the huge source code for SNIPPETS. We were tasked initially with locating and fixing bugs in the code and then adding features to this code base. For example, I created functionality that

 - allowed a user to manualy choose an avatar from existing avatars or upload one of their own 

 - added a timestamp for induvidual comments

 - addeed search and delete functionality to the post thread

 - created custom endpoints that captured the user email and added it to the data model. 

 Overall, this gave a a good opportunity to work with a large code base created by another developer that required I first get amiliar with the code before making any changes or fixes.
